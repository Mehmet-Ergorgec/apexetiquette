## Why Etiquette?

Apex Legends is almost exclusively a 3-person squad-based game, and success or failure at the game is largely a factor of teamwork. Unlike some other battle royale games with squad modes, like Fortnite for example, most players will not find success playing as a "solo squad". However, many players seem to lack a basic understanding of teamwork, which generally leads to anger as well as counterproductive gameplay. So this "how to guide" is designed to give some basic guidelines of how to play as a team.
