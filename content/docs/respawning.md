# Revive and Respawn Etiquette

Here's what to do if you find yourself awaiting revive or respawn or if your teammate is knocked or killed.

## Reviving or Respawning Your Teammate

### Reviving

Here are some good teammate guidelines for reviving your teammate:

* Revive your teammates at the first reasonably safe opportunity. Do not loot first.
* Do not revive your teammate in when doing so will likely result in you both being killed (with rare exception when there is a lack of better options)

### Banner Pickup

The best option is to pick up your teammates banner at the first safe opportunity following a fight. Do not loot first. If you are in the midst of a fight and your teammate's banner is timing out, it can be worth the additional risk of grabbing a banner during a firefight. The banner animation can be slow, so take that into account as you are vulnerable at this time. However, it is often worth a "side mission" during a firefight to rescue a banner near timeout.

### Respawn Beacon

Here are some rules of etiquette when respawning a teammate:

* If there is a nearby beacon that is within the ring (or with enough time before it falls outside the ring), bring your teammate back first - prior to looting. This gives you the best chance with a full squad and them an opportunity to retrieve their loot.
* If immediate respawning is not available, respawn them at the nearest safe beacon - away from any ongoing firefights.
* Stay nearby to cover your teammate during respawn. They are vulnerable and the drop ship draws immediate attention, so keep within a distance where you can assist should enemies arrive. After all, what's the point of respawning them at all if you intend to abandon them to immediate death?

## Waiting to Be Revived or Respawned

For the love of God...

* Do not repeatedly and incessantly ping your death box for banner pickup - in general, but especially during a firefight.
* Do not repeatedly and incessantly ping your the respawn beacon - in general, but especially during a firefight.
* Do not yell at your teammates for causing your demise.
* Do not yell at your teammates should they need to loot your box for urgent health or ammo (see [loot boxes](/docs/lootboxes/) for more).
* Do not yell at your teammates should they loot your box that will be inaccessible due to ring closure (see [loot boxes](/docs/lootboxes/) for more).
* Do not yell at your teammates or insist that they revive or respawn you during a firefight.
